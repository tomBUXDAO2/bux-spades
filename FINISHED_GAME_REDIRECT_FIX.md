# Finished Game Redirect Bug - Fix Documentation

## The Problem
After a game finished (status = FINISHED), players who left the table would still be redirected back to the finished game when they reopened the app. This created a poor user experience where players couldn't return to the lobby after a game ended.

## Root Cause Analysis

### What Was Happening:
1. When a game finished, the server set status to 'FINISHED'
2. Player's `activeGameId` remained in their Redis session
3. When player left the table, their `activeGameId` was NOT cleared
4. On app reopen/reconnect, server's `authenticate` handler checked if user had an `activeGameId`
5. Server validated the game existed and user was a player
6. **BUG**: Server did NOT check if game status was 'FINISHED'
7. Server set `validActiveGameId` and redirected player back to finished game
8. Player got stuck on a finished game table instead of returning to lobby

### The Buggy Flow:
```
Game Finishes → activeGameId still in session → 
Player leaves → activeGameId NOT cleared → 
App reopens → authenticate checks activeGameId → 
Game exists ✓, User is player ✓, Status FINISHED ✗ (not checked) → 
Redirect to finished game ❌
```

## The Fix

### Changes Made:

#### 1. **socketHandlers.js - Authenticate Handler (line 64-92)**
Added check to exclude FINISHED games from being considered valid active games:

```javascript
// BEFORE:
if (gameExists) {
  // Check if user is player...
}

// AFTER:
if (gameExists && gameExists.status !== 'FINISHED') {
  // Check if user is player...
} else if (gameExists && gameExists.status === 'FINISHED') {
  console.log(`[SESSION] User had finished game, not redirecting`);
}
```

#### 2. **gameJoinHandler.js - Leave Game Handler (line 305-308)**
Clear activeGameId from session when player leaves:

```javascript
// ADDED:
const redisSessionService = (await import('../../../services/RedisSessionService.js')).default;
await redisSessionService.clearActiveGame(userId);
console.log(`[GAME LEAVE] Cleared activeGameId from session for user ${userId}`);
```

#### 3. **routes/games.js - Leave Game API (line 275-278)**
Clear activeGameId from session when player leaves via REST API:

```javascript
// ADDED:
const redisSessionService = (await import('../services/RedisSessionService.js')).default;
await redisSessionService.clearActiveGame(userId);
console.log(`[API] Cleared activeGameId from session for user ${userId}`);
```

#### 4. **ScoringService.js - Complete Game (line 551-566)**
Clear all players' activeGameIds when game finishes:

```javascript
// ADDED after game status set to FINISHED:
const gamePlayers = await prisma.gamePlayer.findMany({
  where: { gameId },
  select: { userId: true }
});

const redisSessionService = (await import('./RedisSessionService.js')).default;
for (const player of gamePlayers) {
  await redisSessionService.clearActiveGame(player.userId);
  console.log(`[SCORING] Cleared activeGameId for player ${player.userId}`);
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Authentication Flow:
1. User reconnects/reopens app
2. Server checks Redis session for `activeGameId`
3. **NEW**: Server checks if game status is 'FINISHED'
4. If FINISHED → Don't set as validActiveGameId → No redirect
5. If WAITING/BIDDING/PLAYING → Valid → Redirect to game

### Leave Game Flow:
1. Player clicks leave game
2. Server removes player from game
3. **NEW**: Server clears player's `activeGameId` from session
4. Player can freely navigate without being redirected back

### Game Completion Flow:
1. Game reaches completion condition
2. Server sets status to 'FINISHED'
3. **NEW**: Server clears `activeGameId` for all players
4. All players can now leave and won't be redirected back

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Leave During Active Game
1. Join a game (status = WAITING/BIDDING/PLAYING)
2. Leave the table
3. Close app
4. Reopen app
5. **VERIFY**: Should NOT be redirected to game
6. **VERIFY**: Should land on lobby/home page

### Test 2: Leave After Game Finishes
1. Complete a full game (status = FINISHED)
2. View end screen
3. Leave the table
4. Close app
5. Reopen app
6. **VERIFY**: Should NOT be redirected to finished game
7. **VERIFY**: Should land on lobby/home page

### Test 3: Disconnect During Game
1. Join a game
2. Start game (status = BIDDING or PLAYING)
3. Close app WITHOUT leaving
4. Reopen app
5. **VERIFY**: SHOULD be redirected back to active game
6. Game completes (status = FINISHED)
7. Close app
8. Reopen app
9. **VERIFY**: Should NOT be redirected back (game is finished)

### Test 4: Multiple Players End Game
1. Have 4 players complete a game
2. All players see end screen
3. Each player leaves at different times
4. All players close and reopen app
5. **VERIFY**: No player is redirected to finished game
6. **VERIFY**: All players land on lobby

## Technical Notes

### Why Three Places to Clear activeGameId?

1. **When player leaves** (gameJoinHandler + routes/games):
   - Immediate cleanup when user explicitly leaves
   - Prevents redirect if they leave mid-game
   - Covers both socket and REST API paths

2. **When game finishes** (ScoringService):
   - Cleanup for ALL players simultaneously
   - Safety net if player doesn't explicitly leave
   - Ensures finished games never redirect anyone

### Redis Session TTL
- Sessions expire after some time anyway (SESSION_TTL)
- But we can't rely on that for UX - need immediate cleanup
- Explicit clearing ensures instant user experience improvement

### Reconnection vs New Session
- If player disconnects (doesn't leave), they SHOULD be redirected back
- We check `leftAt` field in GamePlayer to distinguish
- Only clear activeGameId on explicit leave or game finish

## Why This Matters
This bug was affecting user experience because:
1. Players couldn't return to lobby after games ended
2. Created confusion about whether game was still active
3. Made it difficult to start new games
4. Players had to manually navigate away from finished games

The fix ensures clean session management and proper navigation flow, improving the overall user experience and game lifecycle management.
