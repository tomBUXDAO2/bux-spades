## Game Rules

### Basic Spades Rules
- Spades are always trump
- Must follow suit if possible
- Highest card of the led suit wins unless a spade is played
- Highest spade wins if any spades are played

### Scoring Rules
#### Basic Scoring
- Each trick is worth 10 points
- Bidding and making exactly your bid: 10 points per trick × bid amount
- Overtricks (bags): 1 point each
- Every 10 bags = -100 point penalty
- After earning the -100 point penalty, bags reset to 0
- Failing to make bid: -10 points per trick bid
- Nil bid (making it): 100 points
- Blind nil bid (making it): 200 points
- Failing nil bid: -100 points
- Failing blind nil bid: -200 points

#### Bag Rules
- Bags are overtricks (tricks won beyond your bid)
- Each bag is worth 1 point
- Every 10 bags = -100 point penalty
- After earning the -100 point penalty, bags reset to 0
- Bags are tracked separately from regular points
- Example: If you have 9 bags and get 2 more, you get:
  - 2 points for the bags
  - -100 point penalty
  - Bags reset to 1

#### Team Scoring
- Partners' points are combined
- Bags are combined between partners
- Team must reach minimum points to win (e.g., 500)
- Team must not reach maximum negative points to avoid losing (e.g., -200)

#### Game Mode Scoring
All game modes use the same scoring system, with differences only in bidding rules:
- **Regular**: Standard bidding with optional nil and blind nil
- **Whiz**: Must bid nil or number of spades in hand
- **Mirror**: Forced to bid number of spades in hand
- **Gimmick**: Forced specific bids:
  - Hearts bid: Must bid hearts
  - Bid 3: Must bid 3
  - Bid 4 or nil: Must bid either 4 or nil
  - Suicide: One partner from each team must bid nil

### Special Rules
- **Screamer**: Cannot play spades unless following spade lead or no other suits available
- **Assassin**: Must cut and lead spades when possible
- **Blind Nil**: Option to bid nil before seeing cards
- **Suicide**: One partner from each team must bid nil
